		This study investigates the implementation of financial education for children through the development of an educational digital game, "Financial Mystery: Chico's Journey," using RPG Maker MZ technology. Targeted at 5th-grade students, the game aligns with the National Strategy for Financial Education (ENEF), promoting the teaching of financial concepts through an interactive RPG narrative. Player choices impact the storyline, offering an immersive and reflective educational experience on resource management, economics, and financial planning. Critical analysis highlights the game's effectiveness in engaging the target audience and emphasizes the importance of practical testing and narrative content expansion. The study underscores the significance of innovative and interactive teaching methods in the financial education of children, aiming to build a more economically conscious and balanced society.
